    <outline text="What is Dentro?">
        <outline text="Dentro is a cross platform single-pane outliner, written in XUL/JavaScript and based on Mozilla technology. It reads from and writes to OPML, which is a format designed from the ground up to handle outliners. One of its purposes will be to serve as a project manager/to-do list. It also has some other features in the pipeline.">

        <outline text="According to Wikipedia, an outliner is">
            <outline text="a computer program that allows text to be organized into discrete sections that are related in a tree structure or hierarchy. Text may be collapsed into a node, or expanded and edited. Outliners are typically used for computer programming, collecting or organizing ideas, as personal information management or for project management.">

It fits with the way we think, with the way we organize our thoughts, and, most importantly, with the way machines ">

    <outline text="Why is Dentro?">
        <outline text="As always, an itch was in need to be scratched, and nothing available was there to scratch it. Everything was either too limited, not cross-platform, or non-GUI. I realised the only way to have my cake and eat it too will be to create a cake that can, by design, be had and be eaten.">

from your package manager (if you
happen to run a distro that happen to have XULRunner packaged, like (Debian)[http://debian.org]).
Once that's installed or unzipped, download dentro (or git-clone it), then run the following from a terminal">
