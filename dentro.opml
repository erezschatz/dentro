                <outline text="According to Wikipedia">
                    <outline text="a computer program that allows text to be organized into discrete sections that are related in a tree structure or hierarchy.

                <outline text="for all our attempts to bridge the gap between man and machine, the most accessible, immediate solution is the tree structure, and its implementations, mostly the outliner. It fits with the way we think, with the way we organize our thoughts, and, most importantly, also applies to the way machines &quot;think&quot; ">

    <outline text="Why is Dentro?">
        <outline text="As always, an itch was in need to be scratched, and nothing available was there to scratch it. Everything was either too limited, not cross-platform, or non-GUI.
